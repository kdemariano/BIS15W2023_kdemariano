## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
For this warm-up, please use the `heartrate` data. Be sure to label your plots!

1. Make a plot that compares the heartrate of patients for drug a.
```{r}
heartrate<- read.csv(here("data", "heartrate.csv"))
heartrate %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=patient, y=a))+ geom_col()
```

2. Make a plot that compares heartrate (as a range) for each drug.
```{r}
heartrate %>%
  pivot_longer(-patient,
               names_to = "drug",
               values_to= "heartrate") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=drug, y=heartrate, fill=drug))+ geom_boxplot()
```
